                    <p>EVA helps those who need help to become the best person that they can possibly be. Compassion is a key moral emotion  or motivation 
that deserves to be further explored through positive computing, or technology for well-being. Self-compassion can help
peopleâ€™s overall well-being through kindness towards
oneself, connectedness to greater humanity, and mindfulness.</p>
